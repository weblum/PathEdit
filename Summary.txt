C# project in WPF to display a user's PATH variable and allow him to edit it
and save it back to the registry and notify the system that it has changed by
using the WM_SETTINGCHANGE message.

This project also demonstates a hack to overcome the WPF limitation that no
way exists to display a resizable window that does not have a maximize box or
minimize box.

I wanted to restrict the height of the window because it just did not make
sense to make it any higher than the controls' heights.  But I wanted to
allow the user to make the window wider in case he needed to enter a very
long string without scrolling.  When you restrict the height and then
maximize the window, it looks really weird, so I wanted to make that
impossible.  But in WPF, you can't do that.

STACK OVERFLOW FLAME:

Somebody asked the exact question:  "Is there an option to disable the
maximize button while keeping the resize feature?"  And the fucking asshole
that replied did not answer the question.  He essentially said it was a
stupid question.  His exact words were:  "Why would you want to disable the
maximize button, yet allow the window to be resized?"  I want to know why
this shithead thinks it is more important for him to know why somebody asked
the question than it is to answer the fucking question?!
